- Special IS[1] 17-bit instruction set:
    Execution:
        Next PC: 49
        Instructions: 570
    Pipelines Statistics:
        CPI: 1.45
        RAW Stall: 0
        Branch Stall: 126
        Speedup: 3.45
        Speedup (clock):0.99

- Special IS[2]
    Execution:
        Next PC: 9
        Instructions: 9
    Pipelines Statistics:
        CPI: 1.44
        RAW Stall: 0
        Branch Stall: 0
        Speedup: 3.46
        Speedup (clock):0.99


In conclusion, using the Special IS[2] ends up to be faster in time (writing the code and execution) 
and CPI than implementing multiplication with the Special IS[1] 17-bit instruction set 
because MUL is implemented in the hardware thus reducing the clock cycle and the number of instructions.
